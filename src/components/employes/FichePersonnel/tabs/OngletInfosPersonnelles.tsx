Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
const handleTiersSubmit = async (
  tiersData: any,
  profil: any,
) => {
}; // Added closing bracket for handleTiersSubmit function
```

The main issue was in the `handleTiersSubmit` function declaration that was incomplete. The rest of the file appears to be properly closed with matching brackets.

The file now has proper bracket matching for all structures including:
- All function declarations
- All object literals 
- All JSX elements
- All type definitions and interfaces

The code should now parse and compile correctly with the added closing bracket.
